Class 01: CSS Floats

## Overview

Students who completed Code 201 should have a fundamental understanding of float-based layouts. The corresponding lab assignment will have students working with floats in conjunction with media queries. Emphasize that each box should have a unique color in each view, so a total of 18 unique colors. The wireframes are intentionally greyscale to allow students to decide what colors to use. Introduce students to collections of color schemes [like this one](https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/), which can be helpful for those who do not consider themselves creative. 

Students will complete this lab for a second time during lab 5. The second pass-through will require students to use Flexbox. For courses running afternoon lectures in the day track, this lab will be published and completed on Monday morning prior to lecture 6.
