  Class 09: Persistence with a SQL database, continued

## Overview

Today will likely be a catch-up day as students continue to persist their API results in their databases. You can expect most students to have their database functioning locally and storing records, but they may not have completed the logic to either send the database results or request the data from the API.

Today's lecture will likely involve continued discussion of data modeling, joins, and primary and foreign keys.

Today is a good day for group discussions on how to approach the remaining feature tasks from lab 8. It is also a good opportunity for a group debugging session. Select a volunteer to present their code on the screen and allow the rest of the class to help navigate the student(s) to debug their code base. Your role in this process is to ensure that students take turns making suggestions without speaking over each other, but you should not be leading the navigation of this process.

## How do I prep for today?

The only new feature task is to follow the same pattern from lab 8 to retrieve data from the Hiking Project API for trails and campgrounds near the searched location.
