Lab 00: Preparation

## Overview

The Code 301 course is designed to run on a staggered schedule with lecture occurring in the afternoon and the corresponding lab assignment being completed the following morning. For example, lecture will occur on a Monday afternoon, then the lab assignment will be completed on Tuesday morning. New material will then be delivered in lecture on Tuesday afternoon.

Prior to the first lecture, students will arrive on campus at 9 a.m. and will have several independent assignments to complete and submit the corresponding assignments in Canvas. 

Kick off this time with a brief introduction of yourself and the TA team so students know who to ask when they need assistance. During this introductory time, provide a link to the course repository on GitHub and point out the three lab 00 assignments.

Remind students that they will need to meet back in the assigned classroom at a specific time for kickoff with the campus director and should check the clock periodically so they allow enough time for lunch.

Use this morning time prior to the first lecture to assist with any set-up issues from the prework assignments. Also, this is a good time to check in with any students who have tested into Code 301. Gauge their familiarity with the tools used, such as GitHub and the command line.
