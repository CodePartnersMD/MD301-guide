## Feature Tasks

Follow these instructions carefully and in order.

1. Open the `index.html` file in the browser to ensure that it works.
1. In the `app.js` file, turn all `var` variable declarations into `let`.
1. After you do, there will be one error. Find that line in the code, delete that line and respond to the adjacent TODO item.
1. Return to the browser to ensure that the code works again.
1. Now, in the code, convert all `let` variable declarations into `const`.
1. Several bugs will erupt. Debug by using the error messages in the browser console, turning `const` declarations back into `let` where necessary. Expect there to be some back-and-forth between your code editor and your browser.
1. When you think you have things working, clear local storage and reload the page to ensure that the code still works when starting from a totally clean state.
1. As a refresher on template literal notation, find all concatenations in the code and convert them into template literal notation.
1. Reload the browser to ensure that the code works as expected.
1. When finished, push your branch back to your fork on GitHub, and merge it into master. Submit the link to this pull request in the corresponding Canvas assignment. You can submit a link to a pull request even if the pull request is closed.
