Lab 10: The Call Stack

## Submission Instructions

- Complete your Feature Tasks for the day (below)
- Submit your annotated code, call stack drawing, and web request-response cycle (WRRC) diagram to your instructor or designated TA
- On Canvas, submit a comment which includes the following:
  - A question within the context of today's lab assignment
  - An observation about the lab assignment, or related 'Ah-hah!' moment
  - How long you spent working on this assignment

## Feature Tasks

- Print your `server.js` file from your fork of your lab 9 repository. Make sure the lines of code are large enough to read and are only printed on one side of the paper. 
- You and your partner(s) will be taking notes, building the call stack, and drawing a WRRC diagram as you complete this exercise. You may use scratch paper, the whiteboard, or online tools such as a word processor or a drawing application. You will be submitting your printed-out code, notes, and diagram(s) as your lab submission, so be prepared to take a picture of the whiteboard, print out your notes, etc. so that your TA can grade your work. Make sure your handwriting and drawings are legible.
- Plan to spend approximately two hours on one partner's `server.js` code, then switch roles.
- When you are reviewing your own code:
  - You are in charge of drawing a WRRC diagram of the components involved. Your diagram must include the following terms: request, response, client, query, server, database, model, view, controller, port
  - Indicate the line of code from your `server.js` file that corresponds to each portion of the diagram
- When you are reviewing your partner's code:
  - You are in charge of tracing the order in which the code is executed. Write notes in the printed-out `server.js` file. Also, draw the call stack, adding and removing functions as you trace the code execution.
- After two hours have passed, switch roles and use the other partner's code
