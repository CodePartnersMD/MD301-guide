## Overview of today's warm-up challenge

Problems with this code:
- partials are missing "include"
- partials have an equal sign where they shouldn't
- CSS has src attibute instead of href attribute
- class attribute is classes
- phoneNumber class should be kabob-case, not camelCase
- method and action values are swapped, forward slashes are also in the wrong place
- method and action attributes are on the main element instead of form element
- type attributes are incorrect on each input element
- placeholder attribute belongs on the label element, not the input element
