Class 03: Flexbox and templating 

## Overview

Today will introduce several concepts which will lead to several refactors of the lab assignment. For example, students will style their applications using Flexbox and will render their images using Handlebars.

## How do I prep for today?

- Remind students that they will work with the same partner for labs 2 and 3.
- Prepare a demo to show how to refactor their lab code using Handlebars.
- Prepare a demo on Flexbox.
- Prepare a 10-15 demonstration to introduce the topic of today's code challenges.

## What changed from the previous class?

- Students will use Flexbox instead of floats for styling.
- Students will use Handlebars to render their images.
- There is a second set of images in another JSON file.

## What might students struggle with today?
