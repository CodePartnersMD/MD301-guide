# Class 04: Responsive Web Design and Regular Expressions  

## Overview

Today's class is a combination of more CSS topics and an introduction to regular expressions. This is the first of two days where regular expressions will be covered, so keep the demo to the basics and show multiple examples. The additional pattern matching lecture occurs in class 14, with corresponding code challenges.

There are several tools students should bookmark for reference when practicing pattern matching with regular expressions; they are listed in the readings for today's class. Use these tools when introducing regular expressions.

## How do I prep for today?

- Prepare a demo on CSS grids, responsive web design, and icon fonts. These can be one demo or three separate demos.
- Prepare a demo on regular expressions. This can be delivered using an online RegEx tool. If time allows, demonstration how to create a fuzzy search in the photo gallery solution code to search for images by matching keywords.
- Review the starter code for the portfolio assignment. Students can fire this up in the browser using `live-server` or you can point them to the source at [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/prologue).
